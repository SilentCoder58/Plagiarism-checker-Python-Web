# Plagiarism Checker Web Application

This is a **Plagiarism Checker** web application built using **Flask**, **Python**, and **scikit-learn**. The application takes two text samples as input, checks their similarity, and provides a percentage score indicating how similar the two texts are.

## Features
- Allows users to compare two text samples for plagiarism.
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **Cosine Similarity** to compute text similarity.
- Presents the plagiarism similarity score as a percentage.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python to build the web application.
- **scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning, used to implement **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the front-end interface and interaction.
- **Python**: For back-end processing.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Python** (>= 3.6)
2. **Flask** and **scikit-learn** (see installation steps below)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SilentCoder58/plagiarism-checker.git
   cd plagiarism-checker
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or if you don't have the `requirements.txt` file, you can install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install flask scikit-learn
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. Enter two text samples into the provided text boxes.
3. Click the **Check Similarity** button.
4. The app will calculate the similarity between the two text samples and display the result as a percentage.

## Example

### Sample Input 1:

```txt
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
```

### Sample Input 2:

```txt
A fast brown fox leaps over a lazy dog.
```

### Sample Output:

```
Plagiarism Similarity: 72.34%
```

## Folder Structure

```

```

### Explanation:

- **Project Description**: A short description of the project, what it does, and the tools used.
- **Installation**: Clear instructions on how to clone the repository, create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run the app.
- **Usage**: How to use the app after it's set up. It explains the process of entering text, checking the similarity, and seeing the result.
- **Folder Structure**: Helps users understand the organization of the project.
- **License**: A section for licensing (optional, depending on your project).

### Optional Steps:

- If you have a `requirements.txt` file for managing dependencies, include that as well. You can generate it using:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
